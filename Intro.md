**Deep Reinforcement Learning**

**Level 1** : Foundations of Reinforcement Learning

- Learn how to define real-word problems as **Markov Decision Process (MDPs),** so that they can be solved with reinforcement learning.
- **SARSA** and **Q-learning,**
- Techniques such as **tile coding** and **coarse coding** to expand the size of the problems that can be solved with traditional reinforcement learning algorithms.

**Level 2** : Value-Based Methods

- Leverage neural networks when solving problems using the **Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm.**
- **Double Q-learning, prioritized experience replay** and **dueling networks.**

**Level 3** : Policy-Based Methods

- Policy-based and actor-critic methods
  - **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
  - **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**
  - **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)**
- Optimization techniques such as **evolution strategies** and **hill climbing.**

**Level 4** : Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**……..(behind DeepMind&#39;s AlphaZero)
